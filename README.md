# Helplist_Public
Helplist is an app intended to be used by students and teachers for keeping track of queues. The idea is to minimize the effort of queuing for help as a student when the teacher has a lot to do. The main feature which the app is centered around is the list view which shows the current queue.
To get into the list view users first need to get into a list. This is done by either creating a new list (by pressing the create list button) or by joining an existing list (by typing a known list ID into the home screen input field).

In a list, users are either admin or regular. Regular users can only leave the list and add/remove themselves from the queue while admins can remove anyone from queue and edit some other parts of the list (such as the list name).

Another important feature of the app is the drawer of the home screen which is intended to show which lists a user is part of. This is convenient when revisiting the same lists often.
